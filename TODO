If you like to start working on anything, please let me know so work
duplication can be avoided.

* Support non-blocking mode.
This would be an API extension.  It could work by forking a process
and interface to it, or by using a user-specific daemon.  E.g., h =
START(accept_sec_context(...)), FINISHED(h), ret = FINISH(h), ABORT(h).

* Support loadable modules via ldopen, a'la Solaris GSS.
