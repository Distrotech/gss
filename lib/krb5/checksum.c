   *
   *   (1) Each integer field shall be formatted into four bytes, using
   *   little-endian byte ordering, for purposes of MD5 hash
   *   computation.
   *
   *   (2) All input length fields within gss_buffer_desc elements of a
   *   gss_channel_bindings_struct, even those which are zero-valued,
   *   shall be included in the hash calculation; the value elements of
   *   gss_buffer_desc elements shall be dereferenced, and the
   *   resulting data shall be included within the hash computation,
   *   only for the case of gss_buffer_desc elements having non-zero
   *   length specifiers.
   *
   *   (3) If the caller passes the value GSS_C_NO_BINDINGS instead of
   *   a valid channel bindings structure, the Bnd field shall be set
   *   to 16 zero-valued bytes.
