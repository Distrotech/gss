See the end for copying conditions.

GSS is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should expect
it to have security problems.  The API and ABI will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, GSS IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE IN
A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

The code will go through a security review before the stable release
is made.  Volunteers needed.

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.

To compile from CVS, you need texinfo, tex, libtool, automake, and
autoconf.  Bootstrap the build environment with:

  $ make

Then run make again to build it.
