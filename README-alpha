GPL GSS-API README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.
Copyright (C) 2003 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

GPL GSS-API is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You
should expect it to have security problems.  The API and ABI will
likely change.  This is the development release.  A proper release
will be made in due time.  Let me repeat that, GPL GSS-API IS MOST
LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

The code will go through a security review before the stable release
is made.  Volunteers needed.

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.

To compile from CVS, you need perl, texinfo, GTK-DOC, autoconf 2.5+,
and automake 1.7+.  Bootstrap the build environment with:

  $ ./autogen.sh

Then run ./configure etc as usual.
