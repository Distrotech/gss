GSS README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.

GSS is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should expect
it to have security problems.  The API and ABI will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, GSS IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE IN
A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

The code will go through a security review before the stable release
is made.  Volunteers needed.

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.

To compile from CVS, you need texinfo, tex, libtool, automake, and
autoconf.  Bootstrap the build environment with:

  $ ./autogen.sh

Then run ./configure etc as usual.

A note to binary package builders: please build using --disable-shared
because during the development phase, only the so revision will be
bumped on releases.  If you build shared libraries, other packages
that link to them may stop working when a new release of the library
is installed.  The reason for this is simply that the package is not
mature enough to warrant proper shared object versioning.
