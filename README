See the end for copying conditions.

This directory holds the Generic Security Service Library (GSSLib).
See INSTALL for installation instructions, and doc/gss.{info,ps,pdf}
for the manual.

Unless you want to use this library to implement a new GSS mechanism,
you will need to first install Shishi <http://josefsson.org/shishi/>,
as it currently is the only supported mechanism.

The GSS library (lib/) and test suite (tests/) are licensed under the
GNU General Public License license (see COPYING), and the
documentation (doc/) is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation
License.

The other sub-directories are included here for convenience, and are
generated by other tools, or copied from other projects.

If you need help to use Generic Security Service, or wish to help
others, you are invited to join our mailing list help-gss@gnu.org, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gss>.

For updates to the project, see <http://www.gnu.org/software/gss/>.
