This directory holds the Generic Security Service Library (GSSLib).
See ANNOUNCE for an overview, INSTALL for installation instructions,
and doc/gss.{info,ps,pdf} for the manual.

Unless you want to use this library to implement a new GSS mechanism,
you will need to first install Shishi <http://josefsson.org/shishi/>,
as it currently is the only supported mechanism.

The GSS library (lib/) and test suite (tests/) are licensed under the
GNU Public License license (see COPYING), and the documentation (doc/)
is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (see
COPYING.DOC).  The other sub-directories are included here for
convenience, and are generated by other tools, or copied from other
projects.
