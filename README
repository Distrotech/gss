This directory holds the Generic Security Service Library (GSSLib).
See ANNOUNCE for an overview, INSTALL for installation instructions,
and doc/gss.{info,ps,pdf} for the manual.

Unless you want to use this library to implement a new GSS mechanism,
you will need to first install Shishi <http://josefsson.org/shishi/>,
as it currently is the only supported mechanism.

The GSS library (lib/) and test suite (tests/) are licensed under the
GNU General Public License license (see COPYING), and the
documentation (doc/) is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation
License (see COPYING.DOC).

The other sub-directories are included here for convenience, and are
generated by other tools, or copied from other projects.
