@chapter Introduction

GSS is an implementation of the Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSS-API).  GSS-API is used by network servers
(e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to provide security security services, e.g.,
authenticate clients against servers.

GSS contains a library (`libgss'), a command line utility (`gss') to
access the library from the shell, and a manual.

GSS is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.

GSS is licensed under the GNU Public License.

@node Getting Started
@section Getting Started

This manual documents the GSS programming interface.  All functions
and data types provided by the library are explained.

The reader is assumed to possess basic familiarity with GSS-API and
network programming in C or C++.

This manual can be used in several ways.  If read from the beginning
to the end, it gives a good introduction into the library and how it
can be used in an application.  Forward references are included where
necessary.  Later on, the manual can be used as a reference manual to
get just the information needed about any particular interface of the
library.  Experienced programmers might want to start looking at the
examples at the end of the manual, and then only read up those parts
of the interface which are unclear.

@node Features
@section Features

GSS might have a couple of advantages over other libraries doing a
similar job.

@table @asis
@item It's Free Software
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License.

@item It's thread-safe
No global variables are used and multiple library handles and session
handles may be used in parallell.

@item It's internationalized
It handles non-ASCII username and passwords and user visible strings
used in the library (error messages) can be translated into the users'
language.

@item It's portable
It should work on all Unix like operating systems, including Windows.

@node Preparation
@chapter Preparation

To use GSS, you have to perform some changes to your sources and the
build system.  The necessary changes are small and explained in the
following sections.  At the end of this chapter, it is described how
the library is initialized, and how the requirements of the library
are verified.

A faster way to find out how to adapt your application for use with
GSS may be to look at the examples at the end of this manual.

@menu
* Header::
* Initialization::
* Version Check::
* Building the source::
@end menu

@node Header
@section Header

@cindex gssapi.h, gss.h
All standard interfaces (data types and functions) of the GSS are
defined in the header file `gssapi.h'.  In addition, a few
non-standard (not described in the RFC) interfaces of this library are
defined in the header file `gss.h'.  You must include either file in
all programs using the library, either directly or through some other
header file, like this:

@example
#include <gssapi.h>
@end example

The name space of GSS is @code{gss_*} for function names, @code{gss_*}
for data types and @code{GSS_*} for other symbols.  In addition the
same name prefixes with one prepended underscore are reserved for
internal use and should never be used by an application.

@node Initialization
@section Initialization

GSS does not need to be initialized before it can be used.

@node Version Check
@section Version Check

It is often desirable to check that the version of GSS used is indeed
one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility new
features may have been introduced but due to problem with the dynamic
linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to check that
the version is okay right after program startup.

@deftypefun {const char *} gss_check_version (const char * @var{req_version})

@var{req_version}:  version string to compare with, or NULL

Check library version.

 Check that the the version of the library is at
minimum the one given as a string in @code{req_version} and return the
actual version string of the library; return NULL if the condition
is not met.  If @var{NULL} is passed to this function no check is done
and only the version string is returned.  It is a pretty good idea
to run this function as soon as possible, because it may also
intializes some subsystems.  In a multithreaded environment if
should be called before any more threads are created.

@end deftypefun

The normal way to use the function is to put something similar to the
following early in your @code{main()}:

@example
#include <gss.h>
...
  if (!gss_check_version (GSS_VERSION))
    @{
      printf ("gss_check_version() failed:\n"
              "Header file incompatible with shared library.\n");
      exit(1);
    @}
@end example

@node Building the source
@section Building the source
@cindex Compiling your application

If you want to compile a source file including the `gssapi.h' header
file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the @option{-I} option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, GSS uses the external
package @command{pkg-config} that knows the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The options that need to be added to
the compiler invocation at compile time are output by the
@option{--cflags} option to @command{pkg-config gss}.  The following
example shows how it can be used at the command line:

@example
gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config gss --cflags`
@end example

Adding the output of @samp{pkg-config gss --cflags} to the compilers
command line will ensure that the compiler can find the `gssapi.h'
header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the @option{-L} option).  For this, the option
@option{--libs} to @command{pkg-config gss} can be used.  For
convenience, this option also outputs all other options that are
required to link the program with the GSS libarary (for instance, the
@samp{-lshishi} option).  The example shows how to link @file{foo.o}
with GSS into a program @command{foo}.

@example
gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config gss --libs`
@end example

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to @command{pkg-config}:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gss --cflags --libs`
@end example

@node Standard GSS API
@chapter Standard GSS API

As an alternative to the native Shishi programming API, it is possible
to program Shishi through the Generic Security Services (GSS) API.
The advantage of using GSS-API in your security application, instead
of the native Shishi API, is that it will be easier to port your
application between different Kerberos 5 implementations, and even
beyond Kerberos 5 to different security systems, that support GSS-API.

In the free software world, however, the only widely used security
system that supports GSS-API is Kerberos 5, so this advantage is
somewhat academic.  But if you are porting applications using GSS-API
for other Kerberos 5 implementations, or want a more mature and stable
API than the native Shishi API, you may find using Shishi's GSS-API
interface compelling.  Note that GSS-API only offer basic services,
for more advanced uses you must use the native API.

The remaining part of this section assume you are familiar with
GSS-API in general, and only describe how to hook up your application
written using GSS-API with Shishi.  For general GSS-API information,
and some programming examples, a good guide is available online at
@url{http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-1331}.

Shishi exposes the GSS-API through the standard `gssapi.h' header file
and the library `libshishi-gss'.  To avoid conflicting with other
GSS-API implementations on your system, the header file is installed
in a sub-directory `shishi/' under the header file location specified
when building Shishi.  You must include this in all programs using the
library, either directly or through some other header file, like this:

@example
#include <shishi/gssapi.h>
@end example

The library `libshishi-gss' is installed in the normal object code
library location.

To facilitate finding the proper parameters for your compiler, the
@command{pkg-config} tool can be used.  Compile your application
@file{foo.c} with the Shishi GSS interface like this:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config shishi-gss --cflags --libs`
@end example

Of course you do not need to use both @option{--cflags} and
@option{--libs} at the same time, see the full discussion elsewhere in
this manual (@pxref{Building the source}), but note that you must use
`shishi-gss' instead of `shishi' as the library parameter to
@command{pkg-config}.

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code.

@var{initiator_cred_handle}:  Optional handle for credentials claimed.
Supply GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to act as a default initiator principal.
If no default initiator is defined, the function will return
GSS_S_NO_CRED.

@var{context_handle}:  Context handle for new context.  Supply
GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT for first call; use value returned by first call
in continuation calls.  Resources associated with this
context-handle must be released by the application after use with a
call to @code{gss_delete_sec_context()}.

@var{target_name}:  Name of target.

@var{mech_type}:  Optional object ID of desired mechanism. Supply
GSS_C_NO_OID to obtain an implementation specific default

@var{req_flags}:  Contains various independent flags, each of which
requests that the context support a specific service option.
Symbolic names are provided for each flag, and the symbolic names
corresponding to the required flags should be logically-ORed
together to form the bit-mask value.  See below for details.

@var{time_req}:  Optional Desired number of seconds for which context
should remain valid.  Supply 0 to request a default validity
period.

@var{input_chan_bindings}:  Optional Application-specified bindings.
Allows application to securely bind channel identification
information to the security context.  Specify
GSS_C_NO_CHANNEL_BINDINGS if channel bindings are not used.

@var{input_token}:  Optional (see text) Token received from peer
application.  Supply GSS_C_NO_BUFFER, or a pointer to a buffer
containing the value GSS_C_EMPTY_BUFFER on initial call.

@var{actual_mech_type}:  Optional actual mechanism used.  The OID
returned via this parameter will be a pointer to static storage
that should be treated as read-only; In particular the application
should not attempt to free it.  Specify NULL if not required.

@var{output_token}:  Token to be sent to peer application.  If the length
field of the returned buffer is zero, no token need be sent to the
peer application.  Storage associated with this buffer must be
freed by the application after use with a call to
@code{gss_release_buffer()}.

@var{ret_flags}:  Optional various independent flags, each of which
indicates that the context supports a specific service option.
Specify NULL if not required.  Symbolic names are provided for each
flag, and the symbolic names corresponding to the required flags
should be logically-ANDed with the ret_flags value to test whether
a given option is supported by the context. See below for details.

@var{time_rec}:  Optional number of seconds for which the context will
remain valid. If the implementation does not support context
expiration, the value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned.  Specify
NULL if not required.

Initiates the establishment of a security context between the
application and a remote peer.  Initially, the input_token
parameter should be specified either as GSS_C_NO_BUFFER, or as a
pointer to a gss_buffer_desc object whose length field contains the
value zero.  The routine may return a output_token which should be
transferred to the peer application, where the peer application
will present it to gss_accept_sec_context.  If no token need be
sent, gss_init_sec_context will indicate this by setting the length
field of the output_token argument to zero. To complete the context
establishment, one or more reply tokens may be required from the
peer application; if so, gss_init_sec_context will return a status
containing the supplementary information bit GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.
In this case, gss_init_sec_context should be called again when the
reply token is received from the peer application, passing the
reply token to gss_init_sec_context via the input_token parameters.

Portable applications should be constructed to use the token length
and return status to determine whether a token needs to be sent or
waited for.  Thus a typical portable caller should always invoke


int context_established = 0;
gss_ctx_id_t context_hdl = GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT;
...
input_token->length = 0;

while (!context_established) @{
maj_stat = gss_init_sec_context(@code{min_stat}, cred_hdl, @code{context_hdl},
target_name, desired_mech,
desired_services, desired_time,
input_bindings, input_token, @code{actual_mech},
output_token, @code{actual_services},
@code{actual_time});
if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) @{
report_error(maj_stat, min_stat);
@};

if (output_token->length != 0) @{
send_token_to_peer(output_token);

Whenever the routine returns a major status that includes the value
GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the context is not fully established and the


The value returned via the time_rec parameter is undefined Unless
the accompanying ret_flags parameter contains the bit
GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG, indicating that per-message services may be

GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG, GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG, GSS_C_CONF_FLAG,
GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and GSS_C_ANON_FLAG bits returned via the
ret_flags parameter should contain the values that the
implementation expects would be valid if context establishment were
to succeed.  In particular, if the application has requested a
service such as delegation or anonymous authentication via the
req_flags argument, and such a service is unavailable from the
underlying mechanism, gss_init_sec_context should generate a token
that will not provide the service, and indicate via the ret_flags
argument that the service will not be supported.  The application
may choose to abort the context establishment by calling
gss_delete_sec_context (if it cannot continue in the absence of the
service), or it may choose to transmit the token and continue
context establishment (if the service was merely desired but not
mandatory).

The values of the GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG and GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG bits
within ret_flags should indicate the actual state at the time
gss_init_sec_context returns, whether or not the context is fully
established.

GSS-API implementations that support per-message protection are
encouraged to set the GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG in the final ret_flags
returned to a caller (i.e. when accompanied by a GSS_S_COMPLETE
status code).  However, applications should not rely on this
behavior as the flag was not defined in Version 1 of the GSS-API.
Instead, applications should determine what per-message services
are available after a successful context establishment according to
the GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and GSS_C_CONF_FLAG values.

All other bits within the ret_flags argument should be set to
zero.

If the initial call of @code{gss_init_sec_context()} fails, the
implementation should not create a context object, and should leave
the value of the context_handle parameter set to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT
to indicate this.  In the event of a failure on a subsequent call,
the implementation is permitted to delete the "half-built" security
context (in which case it should set the context_handle parameter
to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT), but the preferred behavior is to leave the
security context untouched for the application to delete (using
gss_delete_sec_context).

During context establishment, the informational status bits
GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN and GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN indicate fatal errors,
and GSS-API mechanisms should always return them in association
with a routine error of GSS_S_FAILURE.  This requirement for
pairing did not exist in version 1 of the GSS-API specification, so
applications that wish to run over version 1 implementations must
special-case these codes.

 Returns:

GSS_S_COMPLETE    Successful completion

GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED Indicates that a token from the peer
application is required to complete the
context, and that gss_init_sec_context
must be called again with that token.

GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN Indicates that consistency checks performed
on the input_token failed

GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL Indicates that consistency checks
performed on the credential failed.

GSS_S_NO_CRED     The supplied credentials were not valid for
context initiation, or the credential handle
did not reference any credentials.

GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED The referenced credentials have expired

GSS_S_BAD_BINDINGS The input_token contains different channel
bindings to those specified via the
input_chan_bindings parameter

GSS_S_BAD_SIG     The input_token contains an invalid MIC, or a MIC
that could not be verified

GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN   The input_token was too old.  This is a fatal
error during context establishment

GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN The input_token is valid, but is a duplicate
of a token already processed.  This is a
fatal error during context establishment.

@deftypefun {OM_uint32} gss_delete_sec_context (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_ctx_id_t * @var{context_handle}, gss_buffer_t @var{output_token})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code.

@var{context_handle}:  Context handle identifying context to delete.
After deleting the context, the GSS-API will set this context
handle to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT.

@var{output_token}:  Optional token to be sent to remote application to
instruct it to also delete the context.  It is recommended that
applications specify GSS_C_NO_BUFFER for this parameter, requesting
local deletion only.  If a buffer parameter is provided by the
application, the mechanism may return a token in it; mechanisms
that implement only local deletion should set the length field of
this token to zero to indicate to the application that no token is
to be sent to the peer.

Delete a security context.  @code{gss_delete_sec_context()} will delete
the local data structures associated with the specified security
context, and may generate an output_token, which when passed to the
peer @code{gss_process_context_token()} will instruct it to do likewise.
If no token is required by the mechanism, the GSS-API should set
the length field of the output_token (if provided) to zero.  No
further security services may be obtained using the context
specified by context_handle.

In addition to deleting established security contexts,
@code{gss_delete_sec_context()} must also be able to delete "half-built"
security contexts resulting from an incomplete sequence of
@code{gss_init_sec_context()}/@code{gss_accept_sec_context()} calls.

The output_token parameter is retained for compatibility with
version 1 of the GSS-API.  It is recommended that both peer
applications invoke @code{gss_delete_sec_context()} passing the value
GSS_C_NO_BUFFER for the output_token parameter, indicating that no
token is required, and that @code{gss_delete_sec_context()} should simply
delete local context data structures.  If the application does pass
a valid buffer to @code{gss_delete_sec_context()}, mechanisms are
encouraged to return a zero-length token, indicating that no peer
action is necessary, and that no token should be transferred by the
application.

 Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion, and
GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT if no valid context was supplied.

cryptographic algorithms, if supported by the chosen mechanism.

Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code

@var{input_name_buffer}:  buffer containing contiguous string name to convert

@var{input_name_type}:  Optional Object ID specifying type of printable
name.  Applications may specify either GSS_C_NO_OID to use a
mechanism-specific default printable syntax, or an OID recognized
by the GSS-API implementation to name a specific namespace.

@var{output_name}:  returned name in internal form.  Storage associated
with this name must be freed by the application after use with a call
to @code{gss_release_name()}.

Convert a contiguous string name to internal form.  In general, the
internal name returned (via the <output_name> parameter) will not
be an MN; the exception to this is if the <input_name_type>
indicates that the contiguous string provided via the
<input_name_buffer> parameter is of type GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, in
which case the returned internal name will be an MN for the

@var{output_name_buffer}:  Buffer to receive textual name string.  The
application must free storage associated with this name after use
with a call to @code{gss_release_buffer()}.

@var{output_name_type}:  Optional type of the returned name.  The
returned gss_OID will be a pointer into static storage, and should
be treated as read-only by the caller (in particular, the
application should not attempt to free it). Specify NULL if not
required.

Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of an
opaque internal-form name for display purposes.  The syntax of a
printable name is defined by the GSS-API implementation.

If input_name denotes an anonymous principal, the implementation
should return the gss_OID value GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS as the
output_name_type, and a textual name that is syntactically distinct
from all valid supported printable names in output_name_buffer.

If input_name was created by a call to gss_import_name, specifying
GSS_C_NO_OID as the name-type, implementations that employ lazy
conversion between name types may return GSS_C_NO_OID via the

Generate a canonical mechanism name (MN) from an arbitrary internal
name.  The mechanism name is the name that would be returned to a
context acceptor on successful authentication of a context where
the initiator used the input_name in a successful call to
gss_acquire_cred, specifying an OID set containing <mech_type> as
its only member, followed by a call to gss_init_sec_context,
specifying <mech_type> as the authentication mechanism.

Add an Object Identifier to an Object Identifier set.  This routine
is intended for use in conjunction with gss_create_empty_oid_set
when constructing a set of mechanism OIDs for input to
gss_acquire_cred.  The oid_set parameter must refer to an OID-set
that was created by GSS-API (e.g. a set returned by

member_oid and inserts this copy into the set, expanding the
storage allocated to the OID-set's elements array if necessary.
The routine may add the new member OID anywhere within the elements

@deftypefun {OM_uint32} gss_release_oid_set (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set * @var{set})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code

@var{set}:  The storage associated with the gss_OID_set will be deleted.

Free storage associated with a GSSAPI-generated gss_OID_set object.
The set parameter must refer to an OID-set that was returned from a
GSS-API routine.  @code{gss_release_oid_set()} will free the storage
associated with each individual member OID, the OID set's elements
array, and the gss_OID_set_desc.

Implementations are encouraged to set the gss_OID_set parameter to
GSS_C_NO_OID_SET on successful completion of this routine.

 Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {OM_uint32} gss_release_buffer (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_buffer_t @var{buffer})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code.

@var{buffer}:  The storage associated with the buffer will be deleted.
The gss_buffer_desc object will not be freed, but its length field
will be zeroed.

Free storage associated with a buffer.  The storage must have been
allocated by a GSS-API routine.  In addition to freeing the
associated storage, the routine will zero the length field in the
descriptor to which the buffer parameter refers, and
implementations are encouraged to additionally set the pointer
field in the descriptor to NULL.  Any buffer object returned by a
GSS-API routine may be passed to gss_release_buffer (even if there
is no storage associated with the buffer).

 Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

Check library version.

 Check that the the version of the library is at
minimum the one given as a string in @code{req_version} and return the
actual version string of the library; return NULL if the condition
is not met.  If @var{NULL} is passed to this function no check is done
and only the version string is returned.  It is a pretty good idea
to run this function as soon as possible, because it may also
intializes some subsystems.  In a multithreaded environment if
should be called before any more threads are created.

@node Criticism of GSS
@appendix Criticism of GSS

The author has doubts whether GSS is a good solution for new projects
looking for a implementation agnostic security framework.  We express
these doubts in this section.  GSS can be criticized on several
levels.  We start with the actual implementation.

GSS do not appear to be designed by experienced C programmers.  While
generally this may be a good thing (C is not the best language), but
since they defined the API in C, it is unfortunate.  The primary
evidence of this is the major_status and minor_status error code
solution.  It is a complicated way to describe error conditions, but
what makes matters worse, the error condition is separated; half of
the error condition is in the function return value and the other half
is in the first argument to the function, which is always a pointer to
an integer.  (The pointer is not even allowed to be NULL, if the
application doesn't care about the minor error code.)  This makes the
API unreadable, and difficult to use.  A better solutions would be to
return a struct containing the entire error condition, which can be
accessed using macros, although we acknowledge that the C language
used at the time may not have allowed this (this may in fact be the
reason the awkward solution was chosen).  Instead, the return value
could have been passed back to callers using a pointer to a struct,
accessible using various macros, and the function could have a void
prototype.  The fact that minor_status is placed first in the
parameter list increases the pain it is to use the API.  Important
parameters should be placed first. A better place for minor_status
would have been last in the prototypes.

Another evidence of the C inexperience are the memory management
issues; GSS provides functions to deallocate data stored within, e.g.,
gss_buffer_t but the caller is responsible of deallocating the
gss_buffer_t struct itself.  Memory management issues are error prone,
and this division easily leads to memory leaks (or worse).  Instead,
the API should be the sole owner of all gss_ctx_id_t, gss_cred_id_t,
and gss_buffer_t structures: they should be allocated by the library,
and deallocated (using the utility functions defined for this purpose)
by the library.

TBA: thread issues

TBA: multiple mechanisms in a GSS library

TBA: high-level criticism.

TBA: no credential forwarding.

TBA: krb5: no way to access authorization-data

TBA: krb5: firewall/pre-IP: iakerb status?

TBA: krb5: single-DES only

We also note that very few free security systems uses GSS, perhaps the
only exception to this are Kerberos 5 implementations.  This suggest
that the GSS may not have been so ``generic'' as it was thought to be.

Our conclusion is that any new project that is looking for a security
framework, that is independent of any particular implementation,
should look elsewhere.  In particular SASL is recommended.  The most
compelling argument is that SASL is, as its acronym suggest, Simple,
whereas GSS is not, in any regard.
