@chapter Introduction

GSS is an implementation of the Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSS-API).  GSS-API is used by network servers to
provide security services, e.g., to authenticate SMTP/IMAP clients
against SMTP/IMAP servers.  GSS consists of a library and a manual.

GSS is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.

GSS is a GNU project, and is licensed under the GNU General Public
License.

@node Getting Started
@section Getting Started

This manual documents the GSS programming interface.  All functions
and data types provided by the library are explained.

The reader is assumed to possess basic familiarity with GSS-API and
network programming in C or C++.  For general GSS-API information, and
some programming examples, there is a guide available online at
@url{http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-1331}.

This manual can be used in several ways.  If read from the beginning
to the end, it gives a good introduction into the library and how it
can be used in an application.  Forward references are included where
necessary.  Later on, the manual can be used as a reference manual to
get just the information needed about any particular interface of the
library.  Experienced programmers might want to start looking at the
examples at the end of the manual, and then only read up those parts
of the interface which are unclear.

@node Features
@section Features

GSS might have a couple of advantages over other libraries doing a
similar job.

@table @asis
@item It's Free Software
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License.

@item It's thread-safe
No global variables are used and multiple library handles and session
handles may be used in parallell.

@item It's internationalized
It handles non-ASCII names and user visible strings used in the
library (e.g., error messages) can be translated into the users'
language.

@item It's portable
It should work on all Unix like operating systems, including Windows.

@node GSS-API Overview
@section GSS-API Overview

This section describes GSS-API from a protocol point of view.

The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface
provides security services to calling applications.  It allows a
communicating application to authenticate the user associated with
another application, to delegate rights to another application, and to
apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a
per-message basis.

There are four stages to using the GSS-API:

@enumerate
@item
The application acquires a set of credentials with which it may prove
its identity to other processes. The application's credentials vouch
for its global identity, which may or may not be related to any local
username under which it may be running.

@item
A pair of communicating applications establish a joint security
context using their credentials.  The security context is a pair of
GSS-API data structures that contain shared state information, which
is required in order that per-message security services may be
provided.  Examples of state that might be shared between applications
as part of a security context are cryptographic keys, and message
sequence numbers.  As part of the establishment of a security context,
the context initiator is authenticated to the responder, and may
require that the responder is authenticated in turn.  The initiator
may optionally give the responder the right to initiate further
security contexts, acting as an agent or delegate of the initiator.
This transfer of rights is termed delegation, and is achieved by
creating a set of credentials, similar to those used by the initiating
application, but which may be used by the responder.

To establish and maintain the shared information that makes up the
security context, certain GSS-API calls will return a token data
structure, which is an opaque data type that may contain
cryptographically protected data.  The caller of such a GSS-API
routine is responsible for transferring the token to the peer
application, encapsulated if necessary in an application- application
protocol.  On receipt of such a token, the peer application should
pass it to a corresponding GSS-API routine which will decode the token
and extract the information, updating the security context state
information accordingly.

@item
Per-message services are invoked to apply either: integrity and data
origin authentication, or confidentiality, integrity and data origin
authentication to application data, which are treated by GSS-API as
arbitrary octet-strings.  An application transmitting a message that
it wishes to protect will call the appropriate GSS-API routine
(gss_get_mic or gss_wrap) to apply protection, specifying the
appropriate security context, and send the resulting token to the
receiving application.  The receiver will pass the received token
(and, in the case of data protected by gss_get_mic, the accompanying
message-data) to the corresponding decoding routine (gss_verify_mic or
gss_unwrap) to remove the protection and validate the data.

@item
At the completion of a communications session (which may extend across
several transport connections), each application calls a GSS-API
routine to delete the security context.  Multiple contexts may also be
used (either successively or simultaneously) within a single
communications association, at the option of the applications.

@node Downloading and Installing
@section Downloading and Installing
@cindex Installation
@cindex Download

The package can be downloaded from several places, including
@url{http://josefsson.org/gss/releases/}.  The latest version is
stored in a file, e.g., @samp{gss-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz} where the
@samp{@value{VERSION}} indicate the highest version number.

The package is then extracted, configured and built like many other
packages that use Autoconf.  For detailed information on configuring
and building it, refer to the @file{INSTALL} file that is part of the
distribution archive.

Here is an example terminal session that download, configure, build
and install the package.  You will need a few basic tools, such as
@samp{sh}, @samp{make} and @samp{cc}.

@example
$ wget -q http://josefsson.org/gss/releases/gss-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ tar xfz gss-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ cd gss-@value{VERSION}/
$ ./configure
...
$ make
...
$ make install
...
@end example

After that GSS should be properly installed and ready for use.

@node Bug Reports
@section Bug Reports
@cindex Reporting Bugs

If you think you have found a bug in GSS, please investigate it and
report it.

@itemize @bullet

@item Please make sure that the bug is really in GSS, and
preferably also check that it hasn't already been fixed in the latest
version.

@item You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to
reproduce the bug.

@item You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or
if the results printed are not good and in that case, in what way.
Make sure that the bug report includes all information you would need
to fix this kind of bug for someone else.

@end itemize

Please make an effort to produce a self-contained report, with
something definite that can be tested or debugged.  Vague queries or
piecemeal messages are difficult to act on and don't help the
development effort.

If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the software; if the bug report is poor, we won't
do anything about it (apart from asking you to send better bug
reports).

If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright
incorrect, or if the language needs to be improved, please also send a
note.

@node Contributing
@section Contributing
@cindex Contributing
@cindex Hacking

If you want to submit a patch for inclusion -- from solve a typo you
discovered, up to adding support for a new feature -- you should
submit it as a bug report (@pxref{Bug Reports}).  There are some
things that you can do to increase the chances for it to be included
in the official package.

Unless your patch is very small (say, under 10 lines) we require that
you assign the copyright of your work to the Free Software Foundation.
This is to protect the freedom of the project.  If you have not
already signed papers, we will send you the necessary information when
you submit your contribution.

For contributions that doesn't consist of actual programming code, the
only guidelines are common sense.  Use it.

For code contributions, a number of style guides will help you:

@itemize @bullet

@item Coding Style.
Follow the GNU Standards document (@pxref{top, GNU Coding Standards,,
standards}).

If you normally code using another coding standard, there is no
problem, but you should use @samp{indent} to reformat the code
(@pxref{top, GNU Indent,, indent}) before submitting your work.

@item Use the unified diff format @samp{diff -u}.

@item Return errors.
No reason whatsoever should abort the execution of the library.  Even
memory allocation errors, e.g. when malloc return NULL, should work
although result in an error code.

@item Design with thread safety in mind.
Don't use global variables.  Don't even write to per-handle global
variables unless the documented behaviour of the function you write is
to write to the per-handle global variable.

@item Avoid using the C math library.
It causes problems for embedded implementations, and in most
situations it is very easy to avoid using it.

@item Document your functions.
Use comments before each function headers, that, if properly
formatted, are extracted into Texinfo manuals and GTK-DOC web pages.

@item Supply a ChangeLog and NEWS entries, where appropriate.

@end itemize

@node Planned Features
@section Planned Features
@cindex Todo list
@cindex Future goals

This is also known as the ``todo list''.  If you like to start working
on anything, please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

@itemize
@item Support non-blocking mode.
This would be an API extension.  It could work by forking a process
and interface to it, or by using a user-specific daemon.  E.g., h =
START(accept_sec_context(...)), FINISHED(h), ret = FINISH(h), ABORT(h).

@item Support loadable modules via dlopen, a'la Solaris GSS.

@item Port to Cyclone? CCured?

@node Preparation
@chapter Preparation

To use GSS, you have to perform some changes to your sources and the
build system.  The necessary changes are small and explained in the
following sections.  At the end of this chapter, it is described how
the library is initialized, and how the requirements of the library
are verified.

A faster way to find out how to adapt your application for use with
GSS may be to look at the examples at the end of this manual.

@menu
* Header::
* Initialization::
* Version Check::
* Building the source::
* Out of Memory handling::
@end menu

@node Header
@section Header

@cindex Header files
All standard interfaces (data types and functions) of the official GSS
API are defined in the header file @file{gss/api.h}.  The file is
taken verbatim from the RFC (after correcting a few typos) where it is
known as @file{gssapi.h}.  However, to be able to co-exist gracefully
with other GSS-API implementation, the name @file{gssapi.h} was
changed.

The header file @file{gss.h} includes @file{gss/api.h}, add a few
non-standard extensions (by including @file{gss/ext.h}), takes care of
including header files related to all supported mechanisms (e.g.,
@file{gss/krb5.h}) and finally add C++ namespace protection of all
definitions.  Therefore, including @file{gss.h} in your project is
recommended over @file{gss/api.h}.  If using @file{gss.h} instead of
@file{gss/api.h} causes problems, it should be regarded a bug.

You must include either file in all programs using the library, either
directly or through some other header file, like this:

@example
#include <gss.h>
@end example

The name space of GSS is @code{gss_*} for function names, @code{gss_*}
for data types and @code{GSS_*} for other symbols.  In addition the
same name prefixes with one prepended underscore are reserved for
internal use and should never be used by an application.

Each supported GSS mechanism may want to expose mechanism specific
functionality, and can do so through one or more header files under
the @file{gss/} directory.  The Kerberos 5 mechanism uses the file
@file{gss/krb5.h}, but again, it is included (with C++ namespace
fixes) from @file{gss.h}.

@node Initialization
@section Initialization

GSS does not need to be initialized before it can be used.

In order to take advantage of the internationalisation features in
GSS, e.g. translated error messages, the application must set the
current locale using @code{setlocale()} before calling, e.g.,
@code{gss_display_status()}.  This is typically done in @code{main()}
as in the following example.

@example
#include <gss.h>
#include <locale.h>
...
  setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
@end example

@node Version Check
@section Version Check

It is often desirable to check that the version of GSS used is indeed
one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility new
features may have been introduced but due to problem with the dynamic
linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to check that
the version is okay right after program startup.  The function is
called @code{gss_check_version()} and is described formally in
@xref{Extended GSS API}.

The normal way to use the function is to put something similar to the
following early in your @code{main()}:

@example
#include <gss.h>
...
  if (!gss_check_version (GSS_VERSION))
    @{
      printf ("gss_check_version() failed:\n"
              "Header file incompatible with shared library.\n");
      exit(1);
    @}
@end example

@node Building the source
@section Building the source
@cindex Compiling your application

If you want to compile a source file that includes the @file{gss.h} header
file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the @option{-I} option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, GSS uses the external
package @command{pkg-config} that knows the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The options that need to be added to
the compiler invocation at compile time are output by the
@option{--cflags} option to @command{pkg-config gss}.  The following
example shows how it can be used at the command line:

@example
gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config gss --cflags`
@end example

Adding the output of @samp{pkg-config gss --cflags} to the compilers
command line will ensure that the compiler can find the @file{gss.h} header
file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the @option{-L} option).  For this, the option
@option{--libs} to @command{pkg-config gss} can be used.  For
convenience, this option also outputs all other options that are
required to link the program with the GSS libarary (for instance, the
@samp{-lshishi} option).  The example shows how to link @file{foo.o}
with GSS into a program @command{foo}.

@example
gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config gss --libs`
@end example

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to @command{pkg-config}:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gss --cflags --libs`
@end example

@node Out of Memory handling
@section Out of Memory handling

@cindex Out of Memory handling
@cindex Memory allocation failure
The GSS API does not have a standard error code for the out of memory
error condition.  Instead of adding a non-standard error code, this
library has chosen to adopt a different strategy.  Out of memory
handling happens in rare situations, but performing the out of memory
error handling after almost all API function invocations pollute your
source code and might make it harder to spot more serious problems.
The strategy chosen improve code readability and robustness.

@cindex Aborting execution
For most applications, aborting the application with an error message
when the out of memory situation occur is the best that can be wished
for.  This is how the library behaves by default.

@vindex xalloc_fail_func
However, we realize that some applications may not want to have the
GSS library abort execution in any situation.  The GSS library support
a hook to let the application regain control and perform its own
cleanups when an out of memory situation has occured.  The application
can define a function (having a @code{void} prototype, i.e., no return
value and no parameters) and set the library variable
@code{xalloc_fail_func} to that function.  The variable should be
declared as follows.

@example
extern void (*xalloc_fail_func) (void);
@end example

The GSS library will invoke this function if an out of memory error
occurs.  Note that after this the GSS library is in an undefined
state, so you must unload or restart the application to continue call
GSS library functions.  The hook is only intended to allow the
application to log the situation in a special way.  Of course, care
must be taken to not allocate more memory, as that will likely also
fail.

@node Simple Data Types
@section Simple Data Types

The following conventions are used by the GSS-API C-language bindings:

@subsection Integer types

GSS-API uses the following integer data type:

@verbatim
   OM_uint32    32-bit unsigned integer
@end verbatim

@subsection String and similar data

Many of the GSS-API routines take arguments and return values that
describe contiguous octet-strings.  All such data is passed between
the GSS-API and the caller using the @code{gss_buffer_t} data type.
This data type is a pointer to a buffer descriptor, which consists of
a length field that contains the total number of bytes in the datum,
and a value field which contains a pointer to the actual datum:

@verbatim
   typedef struct gss_buffer_desc_struct {
      size_t    length;
      void      *value;
   } gss_buffer_desc, *gss_buffer_t;
@end verbatim

Storage for data returned to the application by a GSS-API routine
using the @code{gss_buffer_t} conventions is allocated by the GSS-API
routine.  The application may free this storage by invoking the
@code{gss_release_buffer} routine.  Allocation of the
@code{gss_buffer_desc} object is always the responsibility of the
application; unused @code{gss_buffer_desc} objects may be initialized
to the value @code{GSS_C_EMPTY_BUFFER}.

@subsubsection Opaque data types

Certain multiple-word data items are considered opaque data types at
the GSS-API, because their internal structure has no significance
either to the GSS-API or to the caller.  Examples of such opaque data
types are the input_token parameter to @code{gss_init_sec_context}
(which is opaque to the caller), and the input_message parameter to
@code{gss_wrap} (which is opaque to the GSS-API).  Opaque data is
passed between the GSS-API and the application using the
@code{gss_buffer_t} datatype.

@subsubsection Character strings

Certain multiple-word data items may be regarded as simple ISO Latin-1
character strings.  Examples are the printable strings passed to
@code{gss_import_name} via the input_name_buffer parameter. Some
GSS-API routines also return character strings.  All such character
strings are passed between the application and the GSS-API
implementation using the @code{gss_buffer_t} datatype, which is a
pointer to a @code{gss_buffer_desc} object.

When a @code{gss_buffer_desc} object describes a printable string, the
length field of the @code{gss_buffer_desc} should only count printable
characters within the string.  In particular, a trailing NUL character
should NOT be included in the length count, nor should either the
GSS-API implementation or the application assume the presence of an
uncounted trailing NUL.

@subsection Object Identifiers
@anchor{Object Identifiers}

Certain GSS-API procedures take parameters of the type @code{gss_OID},
or Object identifier.  This is a type containing ISO-defined tree-
structured values, and is used by the GSS-API caller to select an
underlying security mechanism and to specify namespaces.  A value of
type @code{gss_OID} has the following structure:

@verbatim
   typedef struct gss_OID_desc_struct {
      OM_uint32   length;
      void        *elements;
   } gss_OID_desc, *gss_OID;
@end verbatim

The elements field of this structure points to the first byte of an
octet string containing the ASN.1 BER encoding of the value portion of
the normal BER TLV encoding of the @code{gss_OID}.  The length field
contains the number of bytes in this value.  For example, the
@code{gss_OID} value corresponding to @code{iso(1)
identified-organization(3) icd-ecma(12) member-company(2) dec(1011)
cryptoAlgorithms(7) DASS(5)}, meaning the DASS X.509 authentication
mechanism, has a length field of 7 and an elements field pointing to
seven octets containing the following octal values:
53,14,2,207,163,7,5. GSS-API implementations should provide constant
@code{gss_OID} values to allow applications to request any supported
mechanism, although applications are encouraged on portability grounds
to accept the default mechanism.  @code{gss_OID} values should also be
provided to allow applications to specify particular name types (see
section 3.10).  Applications should treat @code{gss_OID_desc} values
returned by GSS-API routines as read-only.  In particular, the
application should not attempt to deallocate them with free().

@subsection Object Identifier Sets

Certain GSS-API procedures take parameters of the type
@code{gss_OID_set}.  This type represents one or more object
identifiers (@pxref{Object Identifiers}).  A @code{gss_OID_set} object
has the following structure:

@verbatim
   typedef struct gss_OID_set_desc_struct {
      size_t    count;
      gss_OID   elements;
   } gss_OID_set_desc, *gss_OID_set;
@end verbatim

The count field contains the number of OIDs within the set.  The
elements field is a pointer to an array of @code{gss_OID_desc}
objects, each of which describes a single OID.  @code{gss_OID_set}
values are used to name the available mechanisms supported by the
GSS-API, to request the use of specific mechanisms, and to indicate
which mechanisms a given credential supports.

All OID sets returned to the application by GSS-API are dynamic
objects (the @code{gss_OID_set_desc}, the "elements" array of the set,
and the "elements" array of each member OID are all dynamically
allocated), and this storage must be deallocated by the application
using the @code{gss_release_oid_set} routine.

@node Complex Data Types
@section Complex Data Types

@subsection Credentials

A credential handle is a caller-opaque atomic datum that identifies a
GSS-API credential data structure.  It is represented by the caller-
opaque type @code{gss_cred_id_t}.

GSS-API credentials can contain mechanism-specific principal
authentication data for multiple mechanisms.  A GSS-API credential is
composed of a set of credential-elements, each of which is applicable
to a single mechanism.  A credential may contain at most one
credential-element for each supported mechanism. A credential-element
identifies the data needed by a single mechanism to authenticate a
single principal, and conceptually contains two credential-references
that describe the actual mechanism-specific authentication data, one
to be used by GSS-API for initiating contexts, and one to be used for
accepting contexts.  For mechanisms that do not distinguish between
acceptor and initiator credentials, both references would point to the
same underlying mechanism-specific authentication data.

Credentials describe a set of mechanism-specific principals, and give
their holder the ability to act as any of those principals. All
principal identities asserted by a single GSS-API credential should
belong to the same entity, although enforcement of this property is an
implementation-specific matter.  The GSS-API does not make the actual
credentials available to applications; instead a credential handle is
used to identify a particular credential, held internally by GSS-API.
The combination of GSS-API credential handle and mechanism identifies
the principal whose identity will be asserted by the credential when
used with that mechanism.

The @code{gss_init_sec_context} and @code{gss_accept_sec_context}
routines allow the value @code{GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL} to be specified as
their credential handle parameter.  This special credential-handle
indicates a desire by the application to act as a default principal.

@subsection Contexts

The @code{gss_ctx_id_t} data type contains a caller-opaque atomic
value that identifies one end of a GSS-API security context.

The security context holds state information about each end of a peer
communication, including cryptographic state information.

@subsection Authentication tokens

A token is a caller-opaque type that GSS-API uses to maintain
synchronization between the context data structures at each end of a
GSS-API security context.  The token is a cryptographically protected
octet-string, generated by the underlying mechanism at one end of a
GSS-API security context for use by the peer mechanism at the other
end.  Encapsulation (if required) and transfer of the token are the
responsibility of the peer applications.  A token is passed between
the GSS-API and the application using the @code{gss_buffer_t}
conventions.

@subsection Interprocess tokens

Certain GSS-API routines are intended to transfer data between
processes in multi-process programs.  These routines use a
caller-opaque octet-string, generated by the GSS-API in one process
for use by the GSS-API in another process.  The calling application is
responsible for transferring such tokens between processes in an
OS-specific manner.  Note that, while GSS-API implementors are
encouraged to avoid placing sensitive information within interprocess
tokens, or to cryptographically protect them, many implementations
will be unable to avoid placing key material or other sensitive data
within them.  It is the application's responsibility to ensure that
interprocess tokens are protected in transit, and transferred only to
processes that are trustworthy. An interprocess token is passed
between the GSS-API and the application using the @code{gss_buffer_t}
conventions.

@subsection Names

A name is used to identify a person or entity.  GSS-API authenticates
the relationship between a name and the entity claiming the name.

Since different authentication mechanisms may employ different
namespaces for identifying their principals, GSSAPI's naming support
is necessarily complex in multi-mechanism environments (or even in
some single-mechanism environments where the underlying mechanism
supports multiple namespaces).

Two distinct representations are defined for names:

@itemize
@item An internal form.
This is the GSS-API "native" format for names, represented by the
implementation-specific @code{gss_name_t} type.  It is opaque to
GSS-API callers.  A single @code{gss_name_t} object may contain
multiple names from different namespaces, but all names should refer
to the same entity.  An example of such an internal name would be the
name returned from a call to the @code{gss_inquire_cred} routine, when
applied to a credential containing credential elements for multiple
authentication mechanisms employing different namespaces.  This
@code{gss_name_t} object will contain a distinct name for the entity
for each authentication mechanism.

For GSS-API implementations supporting multiple namespaces, objects of
type @code{gss_name_t} must contain sufficient information to
determine the namespace to which each primitive name belongs.

@item Mechanism-specific contiguous octet-string forms.
A format capable of containing a single name (from a single
namespace).  Contiguous string names are always accompanied by an
object identifier specifying the namespace to which the name belongs,
and their format is dependent on the authentication mechanism that
employs the name.  Many, but not all, contiguous string names will be
printable, and may therefore be used by GSS-API applications for
communication with their users.
@end itemize

Routines (@code{gss_import_name} and @code{gss_display_name}) are
provided to convert names between contiguous string representations
and the internal @code{gss_name_t} type.  @code{gss_import_name} may
support multiple syntaxes for each supported namespace, allowing users
the freedom to choose a preferred name
representation. @code{gss_display_name} should use an
implementation-chosen printable syntax for each supported name-type.

If an application calls @code{gss_display_name}, passing the internal
name resulting from a call to @code{gss_import_name}, there is no
guarantee the the resulting contiguous string name will be the same as
the original imported string name.  Nor do name-space identifiers
necessarily survive unchanged after a journey through the internal
name-form.  An example of this might be a mechanism that authenticates
X.500 names, but provides an algorithmic mapping of Internet DNS names
into X.500.  That mechanism's implementation of @code{gss_import_name}
might, when presented with a DNS name, generate an internal name that
contained both the original DNS name and the equivalent X.500 name.
Alternatively, it might only store the X.500 name.  In the latter
case, @code{gss_display_name} would most likely generate a printable
X.500 name, rather than the original DNS name.

The process of authentication delivers to the context acceptor an
internal name.  Since this name has been authenticated by a single
mechanism, it contains only a single name (even if the internal name
presented by the context initiator to @code{gss_init_sec_context} had
multiple components).  Such names are termed internal mechanism names,
or "MN"s and the names emitted by @code{gss_accept_sec_context} are
always of this type.  Since some applications may require MNs without
wanting to incur the overhead of an authentication operation, a second
function, @code{gss_canonicalize_name}, is provided to convert a
general internal name into an MN.

Comparison of internal-form names may be accomplished via the
@code{gss_compare_name} routine, which returns true if the two names
being compared refer to the same entity.  This removes the need for
the application program to understand the syntaxes of the various
printable names that a given GSS-API implementation may support.
Since GSS-API assumes that all primitive names contained within a
given internal name refer to the same entity, @code{gss_compare_name}
can return true if the two names have at least one primitive name in
common.  If the implementation embodies knowledge of equivalence
relationships between names taken from different namespaces, this
knowledge may also allow successful comparison of internal names
containing no overlapping primitive elements.

When used in large access control lists, the overhead of invoking
@code{gss_import_name} and @code{gss_compare_name} on each name from
the ACL may be prohibitive.  As an alternative way of supporting this
case, GSS-API defines a special form of the contiguous string name
which may be compared directly (e.g. with memcmp()).  Contiguous names
suitable for comparison are generated by the @code{gss_export_name}
routine, which requires an MN as input.  Exported names may be re-
imported by the @code{gss_import_name} routine, and the resulting
internal name will also be an MN.  The @code{gss_OID} constant
@code{GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME} indentifies the "export name" type, and
the value of this constant is given in Appendix A.  Structurally, an
exported name object consists of a header containing an OID
identifying the mechanism that authenticated the name, and a trailer
containing the name itself, where the syntax of the trailer is defined
by the individual mechanism specification.  The precise format of an
export name is defined in the language-independent GSS-API
specification [GSSAPI].

Note that the results obtained by using @code{gss_compare_name} will
in general be different from those obtained by invoking
@code{gss_canonicalize_name} and @code{gss_export_name}, and then
comparing the exported names.  The first series of operation
determines whether two (unauthenticated) names identify the same
principal; the second whether a particular mechanism would
authenticate them as the same principal.  These two operations will in
general give the same results only for MNs.

The @code{gss_name_t} datatype should be implemented as a pointer
type. To allow the compiler to aid the application programmer by
performing type-checking, the use of (void *) is discouraged.  A
pointer to an implementation-defined type is the preferred choice.

Storage is allocated by routines that return @code{gss_name_t}
values. A procedure, @code{gss_release_name}, is provided to free
storage associated with an internal-form name.

@subsection Channel Bindings

GSS-API supports the use of user-specified tags to identify a given
context to the peer application.  These tags are intended to be used
to identify the particular communications channel that carries the
context.  Channel bindings are communicated to the GSS-API using the
following structure:

@verbatim
   typedef struct gss_channel_bindings_struct {
      OM_uint32       initiator_addrtype;
      gss_buffer_desc initiator_address;
      OM_uint32       acceptor_addrtype;
      gss_buffer_desc acceptor_address;
      gss_buffer_desc application_data;
   } *gss_channel_bindings_t;
@end verbatim

The initiator_addrtype and acceptor_addrtype fields denote the type of
addresses contained in the initiator_address and acceptor_address
buffers.  The address type should be one of the following:

@verbatim
   GSS_C_AF_UNSPEC     Unspecified address type
   GSS_C_AF_LOCAL      Host-local address type
   GSS_C_AF_INET       Internet address type (e.g. IP)
   GSS_C_AF_IMPLINK    ARPAnet IMP address type
   GSS_C_AF_PUP        pup protocols (eg BSP) address type
   GSS_C_AF_CHAOS      MIT CHAOS protocol address type
   GSS_C_AF_NS         XEROX NS address type
   GSS_C_AF_NBS        nbs address type
   GSS_C_AF_ECMA       ECMA address type
   GSS_C_AF_DATAKIT    datakit protocols address type
   GSS_C_AF_CCITT      CCITT protocols
   GSS_C_AF_SNA        IBM SNA address type
   GSS_C_AF_DECnet     DECnet address type
   GSS_C_AF_DLI        Direct data link interface address type
   GSS_C_AF_LAT        LAT address type
   GSS_C_AF_HYLINK     NSC Hyperchannel address type
   GSS_C_AF_APPLETALK  AppleTalk address type
   GSS_C_AF_BSC        BISYNC 2780/3780 address type
   GSS_C_AF_DSS        Distributed system services address type
   GSS_C_AF_OSI        OSI TP4 address type
   GSS_C_AF_X25        X.25
   GSS_C_AF_NULLADDR   No address specified
@end verbatim

Note that these symbols name address families rather than specific
addressing formats.  For address families that contain several
alternative address forms, the initiator_address and acceptor_address
fields must contain sufficient information to determine which address
form is used.  When not otherwise specified, addresses should be
specified in network byte-order (that is, native byte-ordering for the
address family).

Conceptually, the GSS-API concatenates the initiator_addrtype,
initiator_address, acceptor_addrtype, acceptor_address and
application_data to form an octet string.  The mechanism calculates a
MIC over this octet string, and binds the MIC to the context
establishment token emitted by @code{gss_init_sec_context}. The same bindings
are presented by the context acceptor to @code{gss_accept_sec_context}, and a
MIC is calculated in the same way. The calculated MIC is compared with
that found in the token, and if the MICs differ,
@code{gss_accept_sec_context} will return a @code{GSS_S_BAD_BINDINGS} error, and the
context will not be established.  Some mechanisms may include the
actual channel binding data in the token (rather than just a MIC);
applications should therefore not use confidential data as
channel-binding components.

Individual mechanisms may impose additional constraints on addresses
and address types that may appear in channel bindings.  For example, a
mechanism may verify that the initiator_address field of the channel
bindings presented to @code{gss_init_sec_context} contains the correct
network address of the host system.  Portable applications should
therefore ensure that they either provide correct information for the
address fields, or omit addressing information, specifying
@code{GSS_C_AF_NULLADDR} as the address-types.

@node Optional Parameters
@section Optional Parameters

Various parameters are described as optional.  This means that they
follow a convention whereby a default value may be requested.  The
following conventions are used for omitted parameters.  These
conventions apply only to those parameters that are explicitly
documented as optional.

@itemize
@item gss_buffer_t types.
Specify GSS_C_NO_BUFFER as a value.  For an input parameter this
signifies that default behavior is requested, while for an output
parameter it indicates that the information that would be returned via
the parameter is not required by the application.

@item Integer types (input).
Individual parameter documentation lists values to be used to indicate
default actions.

@item Integer types (output).
Specify NULL as the value for the pointer.

@item Pointer types.
Specify NULL as the value.

@item Object IDs.
Specify GSS_C_NO_OID as the value.

@item Object ID Sets.
Specify GSS_C_NO_OID_SET as the value.

@item Channel Bindings.
Specify GSS_C_NO_CHANNEL_BINDINGS to indicate that channel bindings
are not to be used.
@end itemize

@node Error Handling
@section Error Handling

@cindex status codes
@cindex mechanism status codes
Every GSS-API routine returns two distinct values to report status
information to the caller: GSS status codes and Mechanism status
codes.

@subsection GSS status codes

GSS-API routines return GSS status codes as their @code{OM_uint32}
function value.  These codes indicate errors that are independent of
the underlying mechanism(s) used to provide the security service.  The
errors that can be indicated via a GSS status code are either generic
API routine errors (errors that are defined in the GSS-API
specification) or calling errors (errors that are specific to these
language bindings).

A GSS status code can indicate a single fatal generic API error from
the routine and a single calling error.  In addition, supplementary
status information may be indicated via the setting of bits in the
supplementary info field of a GSS status code.

These errors are encoded into the 32-bit GSS status code as follows:

@verbatim
      MSB                                                        LSB
      |------------------------------------------------------------|
      |  Calling Error | Routine Error  |    Supplementary Info    |
      |------------------------------------------------------------|
   Bit 31            24 23            16 15                       0
@end verbatim

Hence if a GSS-API routine returns a GSS status code whose upper 16
bits contain a non-zero value, the call failed.  If the calling error
field is non-zero, the invoking application's call of the routine was
erroneous.  Calling errors are defined in table 3-1.  If the routine
error field is non-zero, the routine failed for one of the routine-
specific reasons listed below in table 3-2.  Whether or not the upper
16 bits indicate a failure or a success, the routine may indicate
additional information by setting bits in the supplementary info field
of the status code. The meaning of individual bits is listed below in
table 3-3.

@findex GSS_CALLING_ERROR
@findex GSS_ROUTINE_ERROR
@findex GSS_SUPPLEMENTARY_INFO
@findex GSS_ERROR
All GSS_S_xxx symbols equate to complete @code{OM_uint32} status
codes, rather than to bitfield values.  For example, the actual value
of the symbol @code{GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE} (value 3 in the routine error
field) is 3<<16.  The macros @code{GSS_CALLING_ERROR},
@code{GSS_ROUTINE_ERROR} and @code{GSS_SUPPLEMENTARY_INFO} are
provided, each of which takes a GSS status code and removes all but
the relevant field.  For example, the value obtained by applying
@code{GSS_ROUTINE_ERROR} to a status code removes the calling errors
and supplementary info fields, leaving only the routine errors field.
The values delivered by these macros may be directly compared with a
@code{GSS_S_xxx} symbol of the appropriate type.  The macro
@code{GSS_ERROR} is also provided, which when applied to a GSS status
code returns a non-zero value if the status code indicated a calling
or routine error, and a zero value otherwise.  All macros defined by
GSS-API evaluate their argument(s) exactly once.

A GSS-API implementation may choose to signal calling errors in a
platform-specific manner instead of, or in addition to the routine
value; routine errors and supplementary info should be returned via
major status values only.

The GSS major status code @code{GSS_S_FAILURE} is used to indicate
that the underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific
GSS status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code will
provide more details about the error.

In addition to the explicit major status codes for each API function,
the code @code{GSS_S_FAILURE} may be returned by any routine,
indicating an implementation-specific or mechanism-specific error
condition, further details of which are reported via the
@code{minor_status} parameter.

@subsection Mechanism-specific status codes

GSS-API routines return a minor_status parameter, which is used to
indicate specialized errors from the underlying security mechanism.
This parameter may contain a single mechanism-specific error,
indicated by a @code{OM_uint32} value.

The minor_status parameter will always be set by a GSS-API routine,
even if it returns a calling error or one of the generic API errors
indicated above as fatal, although most other output parameters may
remain unset in such cases.  However, output parameters that are
expected to return pointers to storage allocated by a routine must
always be set by the routine, even in the event of an error, although
in such cases the GSS-API routine may elect to set the returned
parameter value to NULL to indicate that no storage was actually
allocated.  Any length field associated with such pointers (as in a
@code{gss_buffer_desc} structure) should also be set to zero in such cases.

must be released by the application after use with a call to
gss_release_cred().

Allows an application to acquire a handle for a pre-existing
credential by name.  GSS-API implementations must impose a local
access-control policy on callers of this routine to prevent
unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are not
entitled.  This routine is not intended to provide a "login to the
network" function, as such a function would involve the creation of
new credentials rather than merely acquiring a handle to existing
credentials.  Such functions, if required, should be defined in
implementation-specific extensions to the API.

If desired_name is GSS_C_NO_NAME, the call is interpreted as a request
for a credential handle that will invoke default behavior when passed
to gss_init_sec_context() (if cred_usage is GSS_C_INITIATE or
GSS_C_BOTH) or gss_accept_sec_context() (if cred_usage is GSS_C_ACCEPT
or GSS_C_BOTH).

Mechanisms should honor the desired_mechs parameter, and return a
credential that is suitable to use only with the requested mechanisms.
An exception to this is the case where one underlying credential
element can be shared by multiple mechanisms; in this case it is
permissible for an implementation to indicate all mechanisms with
which the credential element may be used.  If desired_mechs is an
empty set, behavior is undefined.

This routine is expected to be used primarily by context acceptors,
since implementations are likely to provide mechanism-specific ways of
obtaining GSS-API initiator credentials from the system login process.
Some implementations may therefore not support the acquisition of
GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH credentials via gss_acquire_cred for any
name other than GSS_C_NO_NAME, or a name produced by applying either
gss_inquire_cred to a valid credential, or gss_inquire_context to an
active context.

If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the
mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
credential is required (e.g. by gss_init_sec_context or
gss_accept_sec_context).  Such mechanism-specific implementation
decisions should be invisible to the calling application; thus a call
of gss_inquire_cred immediately following the call of gss_acquire_cred
must return valid credential data, and may therefore incur the
overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.

Valid return values and their meaning:

@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.

@code{GSS_S_BAD_MECH}: Unavailable mechanism requested.

@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE}: Type contained within desired_name
parameter is not supported.

@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAME}: Value supplied for desired_name parameter is
ill formed.

acquired Because they have expired.

@var{minor_status}: Integer, modify.  Mechanism specific status code.

@var{input_cred_handle}: gss_cred_id_t, read, optional.  The
credential to which a credential-element will be added.  If
GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified, the routine will compose the new
credential based on default behavior (see description above).  Note
that, while the credential-handle is not modified by gss_add_cred(),
the underlying credential will be modified if output_credential_handle
is NULL.

@var{desired_name}: gss_name_t, read.  Name of principal whose

credentials have the maximum permitted initiator lifetime.

@var{acceptor_time_req}: Integer, read, optional.  number of seconds
that the credential should remain valid for accepting security
contexts.  This argument is ignored if the composed credentials are of
type GSS_C_INITIATE.  Specify GSS_C_INDEFINITE to request that the
credentials have the maximum permitted initiator lifetime.

@var{output_cred_handle}: gss_cred_id_t, modify, optional.  The
returned credential handle, containing the new credential-element and
all the credential-elements from input_cred_handle.  If a valid
pointer to a gss_cred_id_t is supplied for this parameter,
gss_add_cred creates a new credential handle containing all
credential-elements from the input_cred_handle and the newly acquired
credential-element; if NULL is specified for this parameter, the newly
acquired credential-element will be added to the credential identified
by input_cred_handle.

The resources associated with any credential handle returned via this
parameter must be released by the application after use with a call to
gss_release_cred().

@var{actual_mechs}: Set of Object IDs, modify, optional.  The complete
set of mechanisms for which the new credential is valid.  Storage for
the returned OID-set must be freed by the application after use with a
call to gss_release_oid_set(). Specify NULL if not required.

@var{initiator_time_rec}: Integer, modify, optional.  Actual number of
seconds for which the returned credentials will remain valid for
initiating contexts using the specified mechanism.  If the
implementation or mechanism does not support expiration of
credentials, the value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned. Specify NULL
if not required

@var{acceptor_time_rec}: Integer, modify, optional.  Actual number of

if not required

Adds a credential-element to a credential.  The credential-element is
identified by the name of the principal to which it refers.  GSS-API
implementations must impose a local access-control policy on callers
of this routine to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credential-elements to which they are not entitled. This routine is
not intended to provide a "login to the network" function, as such a
function would involve the creation of new mechanism-specific
authentication data, rather than merely acquiring a GSS-API handle to
existing data.  Such functions, if required, should be defined in
implementation-specific extensions to the API.

If desired_name is GSS_C_NO_NAME, the call is interpreted as a request
to add a credential element that will invoke default behavior when
passed to gss_init_sec_context() (if cred_usage is GSS_C_INITIATE or
GSS_C_BOTH) or gss_accept_sec_context() (if cred_usage is GSS_C_ACCEPT
or GSS_C_BOTH).

This routine is expected to be used primarily by context acceptors,
since implementations are likely to provide mechanism-specific ways of
obtaining GSS-API initiator credentials from the system login process.
Some implementations may therefore not support the acquisition of
GSS_C_INITIATE or GSS_C_BOTH credentials via gss_acquire_cred for any
name other than GSS_C_NO_NAME, or a name produced by applying either
gss_inquire_cred to a valid credential, or gss_inquire_context to an
active context.

If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the
mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
credential is required (e.g. by gss_init_sec_context or
gss_accept_sec_context).  Such mechanism-specific implementation
decisions should be invisible to the calling application; thus a call
of gss_inquire_cred immediately following the call of gss_add_cred
must return valid credential data, and may therefore incur the
overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.

This routine can be used to either compose a new credential containing
all credential-elements of the original in addition to the
newly-acquire credential-element, or to add the new credential-
element to an existing credential. If NULL is specified for the
output_cred_handle parameter argument, the new credential-element will
be added to the credential identified by input_cred_handle; if a valid
pointer is specified for the output_cred_handle parameter, a new
credential handle will be created.

If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified as the input_cred_handle,
gss_add_cred will compose a credential (and set the output_cred_handle
parameter accordingly) based on default behavior.  That is, the call
will have the same effect as if the application had first made a call
to gss_acquire_cred(), specifying the same usage and passing
GSS_C_NO_NAME as the desired_name parameter to obtain an explicit
credential handle embodying default behavior, passed this credential
handle to gss_add_cred(), and finally called gss_release_cred() on the
first credential handle.

If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified as the input_cred_handle
parameter, a non-NULL output_cred_handle must be supplied.

@code{GSS_S_COMPLETE}: Successful completion.

@code{GSS_S_BAD_MECH}: Unavailable mechanism requested.

@code{GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE}: Type contained within desired_name

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_release_buffer (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_buffer_t @var{buffer})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code.

@var{buffer}:  The storage associated with the buffer will be deleted.
The gss_buffer_desc object will not be freed, but its length field
will be zeroed.

Free storage associated with a buffer.  The storage must have been
allocated by a GSS-API routine.  In addition to freeing the
associated storage, the routine will zero the length field in the
descriptor to which the buffer parameter refers, and
implementations are encouraged to additionally set the pointer
field in the descriptor to NULL.  Any buffer object returned by a
GSS-API routine may be passed to gss_release_buffer (even if there
is no storage associated with the buffer).

Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_create_empty_oid_set (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set * @var{oid_set})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code

@var{oid_set}:  The empty object identifier set. The routine will
allocate the gss_OID_set_desc object, which the application must free
after use with a call to @code{gss_release_oid_set()}.

Create an object-identifier set containing no object identifiers, to
which members may be subsequently added using the
@code{gss_add_oid_set_member()} routine.  These routines are intended
to be used to construct sets of mechanism object identifiers, for
input to gss_acquire_cred.

Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_add_oid_set_member (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{member_oid}, gss_OID_set * @var{oid_set})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code

@var{member_oid}:  The object identifier to copied into the set.

@var{oid_set}:  The set in which the object identifier should be inserted.

Add an Object Identifier to an Object Identifier set.  This routine
is intended for use in conjunction with gss_create_empty_oid_set
when constructing a set of mechanism OIDs for input to
gss_acquire_cred.  The oid_set parameter must refer to an OID-set
that was created by GSS-API (e.g. a set returned by
@code{gss_create_empty_oid_set()}). GSS-API creates a copy of the
member_oid and inserts this copy into the set, expanding the
storage allocated to the OID-set's elements array if necessary.
The routine may add the new member OID anywhere within the elements
array, and implementations should verify that the new member_oid is
not already contained within the elements array; if the member_oid
is already present, the oid_set should remain unchanged.

Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_test_oid_set_member (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{member}, const gss_OID_set @var{set}, int * @var{present})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code

@var{member}:  The object identifier whose presence is to be tested.

@var{set}:  The Object Identifier set.

@var{present}:  output indicating if the specified OID is a member of the
set, zero if not.

Interrogate an Object Identifier set to determine whether a specified
Object Identifier is a member.  This routine is intended to be used
with OID sets returned by @code{gss_indicate_mechs()},
@code{gss_acquire_cred()}, and @code{gss_inquire_cred()}, but will
also work with user-generated sets.

Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_release_oid_set (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set * @var{set})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code

@var{set}:  The storage associated with the gss_OID_set will be deleted.

Free storage associated with a GSSAPI-generated gss_OID_set object.
The set parameter must refer to an OID-set that was returned from a
GSS-API routine.  @code{gss_release_oid_set()} will free the storage
associated with each individual member OID, the OID set's elements
array, and the gss_OID_set_desc.

Implementations are encouraged to set the gss_OID_set parameter to
GSS_C_NO_OID_SET on successful completion of this routine.

Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_indicate_mechs (OM_uint32 *@var{minor_status}, gss_OID_set *@var{mech_set})

@var{minor_status}:  Mechanism specific status code.

@var{mech_set}:  Output OID set with implementation-supported mechanisms.

Allows an application to determine which underlying security
mechanisms are available.

The returned gss_OID_set value will be a dynamically-allocated OID
set, that should be released by the caller after use with a call to
gss_release_oid_set().

Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_display_status (OM_uint32 *@var{minor_status}, OM_uint32 @var{status_value}, int @var{status_type}, const gss_OID @var{mech_type}, OM_uint32 *@var{message_context}, gss_buffer_t @var{status_string})

@var{minor_status}: Mechanism specific status code.

@var{status_value} Status value to be converted

@var{status_type}: Type of status code.  Valid values include
GSS_C_GSS_CODE to indicate that status_value is a GSS status code, and
GSS_C_MECH_CODE to indicate that status_value is a mechanism status
code.

@var{mech_type}: Optional OID of underlying mechanism (used to
interpret a minor status value) Supply GSS_C_NO_OID to obtain the
system default.

@var{message_context}: Input/output variable that should be
initialized to zero by the application prior to the first call.  On
return from gss_display_status(), a non-zero status_value parameter
indicates that additional messages may be extracted from the status
code via subsequent calls to gss_display_status(), passing the same
status_value, status_type, mech_type, and message_context parameters.

@var{status_string}: Output textual interpretation of the
status_value.  Storage associated with this parameter must be freed by
the application after use with a call to gss_release_buffer().

Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of a GSS-API
status code, for display to the user or for logging purposes.  Since
some status values may indicate multiple conditions, applications may
need to call gss_display_status multiple times, each call generating a
single text string.  The message_context parameter is used by
gss_display_status to store state information about which error
messages have already been extracted from a given status_value;
message_context must be initialized to 0 by the application prior to
the first call, and gss_display_status will return a non-zero value in
this parameter if there are further messages to extract.

The message_context parameter contains all state information required
by gss_display_status in order to extract further messages from the
status_value; even when a non-zero value is returned in this
parameter, the application is not required to call gss_display_status
again unless subsequent messages are desired.  The following code
extracts all messages from a given status code and prints them to
stderr:

@example
   OM_uint32 message_context;
   OM_uint32 status_code;
   OM_uint32 maj_status;
   OM_uint32 min_status;
   gss_buffer_desc status_string;

          ...

   message_context = 0;

   do @{


     maj_status = gss_display_status (
                     &min_status,
                     status_code,
                     GSS_C_GSS_CODE,
                     GSS_C_NO_OID,
                     &message_context,
                     &status_string)

     fprintf(stderr,
             "%.*s\n",
            (int)status_string.length,

            (char *)status_string.value);

     gss_release_buffer(&min_status, &status_string);

   @} while (message_context != 0);
@end example

Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE for successful completion, GSS_S_BAD_MECH to
indicate that translation in accordance with an unsupported mechanism
type was requested, and GSS_S_BAD_STATUS to indicate that the status
value was not recognized, or the status type was neither
GSS_C_GSS_CODE nor GSS_C_MECH_CODE.

@chapter Extended GSS API

None of the following functions are standard GSS API functions.  As
such, they are not declared in @file{gss/api.h}, but rather in
@file{gss/ext.h} (which is included from @file{gss.h}).

@deftypefun {const char *} gss_check_version (const char * @var{req_version})

@var{req_version}:  version string to compare with, or NULL

Check that the the version of the library is at minimum the one given
as a string in @code{req_version} and return the actual version string
of the library; return NULL if the condition is not met.  If
@var{NULL} is passed to this function no check is done and only the
version string is returned.  It is a pretty good idea to run this
function as soon as possible, because it may also intializes some
subsystems.  In a multithreaded environment if should be called before
any more threads are created.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int gss_oid_equal (gss_OID @var{first_oid}, gss_OID @var{second_oid})

Compare two OIDs for equality.  Compares actual content, not just
pointer equality.  Returns a boolean true iff the OIDs are equal.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_copy_oid (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{src_oid}, gss_OID @var{dest_oid});

Make an exact copy of the given OID, that shares no memory areas with
the original.  The contents of the copied OID must be deallocated by
the caller.  Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE on success.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun OM_uint32 gss_duplicate_oid (OM_uint32 * @var{minor_status}, const gss_OID @var{src_oid}, gss_OID * @var{dest_oid})

Allocate an exact copy of the given OID, that shares no memory areas
with the original.  The newly created OID, and its contents, must be
deallocated by the caller.  Returns GSS_S_COMPLETE on success.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {int} gss_encapsulate_token (gss_buffer_t @var{input_message}, gss_OID @var{token_oid}, gss_buffer_t @var{output_message})

@var{input_message}: Message to be encapsulated.

@var{token_oid}: OID of mechanism.

@var{input_message}: Output buffer with encapsulated message.

Wrap a buffer in the mechanism-independent token format.  This is used
for the initial token of a GSS-API context establishment sequence.  It
incorporates an identifier of the mechanism type to be used on that
context, and enables tokens to be interpreted unambiguously at GSS-API
peers.  See further section 3.1 of RFC 2743.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {int} gss_decapsulate_token (gss_buffer_t @var{input_message}, gss_OID @var{token_oid}, gss_buffer_t @var{output_message})

@var{input_message}: Message to decapsulated.

@var{token_oid}: Output buffer with mechanism OID used in message.

@var{input_message}: Output buffer with encapsulated message.

Unwrap a buffer in the mechanism-independent token format.  This is
the reverse of @code{gss_encapsulate_token}.  The translation is
loss-less, all data is preserved as is.

@node Criticism of GSS
@appendix Criticism of GSS

The author has doubts whether GSS is the best solution for free
software projects looking for a implementation agnostic security
framework.  We express these doubts in this section, so that the
reader can judge for herself if any of the potential problems
discussed here are relevant for their project, or if the benefit
outweigh the problems.  We are aware that some of the opinions are
highly subjective, but we offer them in the hope they can serve as
anecdotal evidence.

GSS can be criticized on several levels.  We start with the actual
implementation.

GSS does not appear to be designed by experienced C programmers.
While generally this may be a good thing (C is not the best language),
but since they defined the API in C, it is unfortunate.  The primary
evidence of this is the major_status and minor_status error code
solution.  It is a complicated way to describe error conditions, but
what makes matters worse, the error condition is separated; half of
the error condition is in the function return value and the other half
is in the first argument to the function, which is always a pointer to
an integer.  (The pointer is not even allowed to be @code{NULL}, if
the application doesn't care about the minor error code.)  This makes
the API unreadable, and difficult to use.  A better solutions would be
to return a struct containing the entire error condition, which can be
accessed using macros, although we acknowledge that the C language
used at the time GSS was designed may not have allowed this (this may
in fact be the reason the awkward solution was chosen).  Instead, the
return value could have been passed back to callers using a pointer to
a struct, accessible using various macros, and the function could have
a void prototype.  The fact that minor_status is placed first in the
parameter list increases the pain it is to use the API.  Important
parameters should be placed first. A better place for minor_status (if
it must be present at all) would have been last in the prototypes.

Another evidence of the C inexperience are the memory management
issues; GSS provides functions to deallocate data stored within, e.g.,
@code{gss_buffer_t} but the caller is responsible of deallocating the
structure pointed at by the @code{gss_buffer_t} (i.e., the
@code{gss_buffer_desc}) itself.  Memory management issues are error
prone, and this division easily leads to memory leaks (or worse).
Instead, the API should be the sole owner of all @code{gss_ctx_id_t},
@code{gss_cred_id_t}, and @code{gss_buffer_t} structures: they should
be allocated by the library, and deallocated (using the utility
functions defined for this purpose) by the library.

TBA: thread issues

TBA: multiple mechanisms in a GSS library

TBA: high-level design criticism.

TBA: no credential forwarding.

TBA: internationalization

TBA: krb5: no way to access authorization-data

TBA: krb5: firewall/pre-IP: iakerb status?

TBA: krb5: single-DES only

TBA: the API may block, unusable in select() based servers.
Especially if the servers contacted is decided by the, yet
unauthenticated, remote client.

Finally we note that few free security applications uses GSS, perhaps
the only major exception to this are Kerberos 5 implementations.
While not substantial evidence, this do suggest that the GSS may not
be the simplest solution available to solve actual problems, since
otherwise more projects would have chosen to take advantage of the
work that went into GSS instead of using another framework (or
designing their own solution).

Our conclusion is that free software projects that are looking for a
security framework should evaluate carefully whether GSS actually is
the best solution before using it.  In particular it is recommended to
compare GSS with the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
framework, which in several situations provide the same feature as GSS
does.  The most compelling argument for SASL over GSS is, as its
acronym suggest, Simple, whereas GSS is far from it.

However, that said, for free software projects that wants to support
Kerberos 5, we do acknowledge that no other framework provides a more
portable and interoperable interface into the Kerberos 5 system.  If
your project needs to use Kerberos 5 specifically, we do recommend you
to use GSS instead of the Kerberos 5 implementation specific APIs.
