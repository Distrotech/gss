@chapter Introduction

GPL GSS-API is an implementation of the Generic Security Service
Application Program Interface (GSS-API).  GSS-API is used by network
servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to provide security security services,
e.g., authenticate clients against servers.

GPL GSS-API contains a library (`libgss), a command line utility
(`gss) to access the library from the shell, and a manual.

GPL GSS-API is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.

GPL GSS-API is licensed under the GNU Public License.

@node Getting Started
@section Getting Started

This manual documents the GSS programming interface.  All functions
and data types provided by the library are explained.

The reader is assumed to possess basic familiarity with GSS-API and
network programming in C or C++.

This manual can be used in several ways.  If read from the beginning
to the end, it gives a good introduction into the library and how it
can be used in an application.  Forward references are included where
necessary.  Later on, the manual can be used as a reference manual to
get just the information needed about any particular interface of the
library.  Experienced programmers might want to start looking at the
examples at the end of the manual, and then only read up those parts
of the interface which are unclear.

@node Features
@section Features

GSS might have a couple of advantages over other libraries doing a
similar job.

@table @asis
@item It's Free Software
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (@pxref{Copying}).

@item It's thread-safe
No global variables are used and multiple library handles and session
handles may be used in parallell.

@item It's internationalized
It handles non-ASCII username and passwords and user visible strings
used in the library (error messages) can be translated into the users'
language.

@item It's portable
It should work on all Unix like operating systems, including Windows.

@end table

Note that the library do not implement any policy to decide whether a
certain user is ``authenticated'' or ``authorized'' or not.  Rather,
it uses callbacks back into the application to answer these questions.

@node Preparation
@chapter Preparation

To use GSS, you have to perform some changes to your sources and the
build system.  The necessary changes are small and explained in the
following sections.  At the end of this chapter, it is described how
the library is initialized, and how the requirements of the library
are verified.

A faster way to find out how to adapt your application for use with
GSS may be to look at the examples at the end of this manual.

@menu
* Header::
* Initialization::
* Version Check::
* Building the source::
@end menu

@node Header
@section Header

All interfaces (data types and functions) of the library are defined
in the header file `gssapi.h'.  You must include this in all programs
using the library, either directly or through some other header file,
like this:

@example
#include <gssapi.h>
@end example

The name space of `Libggssapi' is @code{gssapi_*} for function names,
@code{gss_*} for data types and @code{GSS_*} for other symbols.  In
addition the same name prefixes with one prepended underscore are
reserved for internal use and should never be used by an application.

@node Initialization
@section Initialization

`Libggssapi' must be initialized before it can be used.  The library is
initialized by calling @code{ggssapi_init()}.
The resources allocated by the initialization process can be released
if the application no longer has a need to call `Libggssapi' functions,
this is done by calling @code{ggssapi_done()}.

In order to take advantage of the internationalisation features in
`Libggssapi', such as translated error messages, the application must
set the current locale using @code{setlocale()} before initializing
`Libggssapi'.

In order to take advantage of the secure memory features in
`Libgcrypt', which subsequently makes sensitive key material used in
`Libggssapi' be allocated in secure memory, you need to initialize
secure memory in your application, and for some platforms even make
your application setuid root.  See the libgcrypt documentation for
more information.  Example code to initialize secure memory in your
code:

@example
#include <gcrypt.h>
...

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
@{
...

  /* Check version of libgcrypt. */
  if (!gcry_check_version (GCRYPT_VERSION))
    die ("version mismatch\n");

  /* Allocate a pool of 16k secure memory.  This also drops priviliges
     on some systems. */
  gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INIT_SECMEM, 16384, 0);

  /* Tell Libgcrypt that initialization has completed. */
  gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INITIALIZATION_FINISHED, 0);
  ...
@end example

If you do not do this, keying material will not be allocated in secure
memory, which for most application is not the biggest secure problem.
Note that `Libggssapi' has not been audited to make sure it only ever
stores passwords or keys in secure memory.

@node Version Check
@section Version Check

It is often desirable to check that the version of `Libggssapi' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility
new features may have been introduced but due to problem with the
dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to
check that the version is okay right after program startup.

@include gss-api-version.texi

The normal way to use the function is to put something similar to the
following early in your @code{main()}:

@example
  if (!ggssapi_check_version (GGSSAPI_VERSION))
    @{
      printf ("ggssapi_check_version() failed:\n"
              "Header file incompatible with shared library.\n");
      exit(1);
    @}
@end example

@node Building the source
@section Building the source
@cindex Compiling your application

If you want to compile a source file including the `ggssapi.h' header
file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the @option{-I} option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, `Libggssapi' uses the
external package @command{pkg-config} that knows the path to the
include file and other configuration options.  The options that need
to be added to the compiler invocation at compile time are output by
the @option{--cflags} option to @command{pkg-config libggssapi}.  The
following example shows how it can be used at the command line:

@example
gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config libggssapi --cflags`
@end example

Adding the output of @samp{pkg-config libggssapi --cflags} to the
compilers command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
`ggssapi.h' header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search path
(via the @option{-L} option).  For this, the option @option{--libs} to
@command{pkg-config libggssapi} can be used.  For convenience, this option
also outputs all other options that are required to link the program
with the `libggssapi' libarary (for instance, the @samp{-lidn}
option).  The example shows how to link @file{foo.o} with the `libggssapi'
library to a program @command{foo}.

@example
gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config libggssapi --libs`
@end example

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to @command{pkg-config}:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config libggssapi --cflags --libs`
@end example

@node Standard GSS API
@chapter Standard GSS API

As an alternative to the native Shishi programming API, it is possible
to program Shishi through the Generic Security Services (GSS) API.
The advantage of using GSS-API in your security application, instead
of the native Shishi API, is that it will be easier to port your
application between different Kerberos 5 implementations, and even
beyond Kerberos 5 to different security systems, that support GSS-API.

In the free software world, however, the only widely used security
system that supports GSS-API is Kerberos 5, so this advantage is
somewhat academic.  But if you are porting applications using GSS-API
for other Kerberos 5 implementations, or want a more mature and stable
API than the native Shishi API, you may find using Shishi's GSS-API
interface compelling.  Note that GSS-API only offer basic services,
for more advanced uses you must use the native API.

The remaining part of this section assume you are familiar with
GSS-API in general, and only describe how to hook up your application
written using GSS-API with Shishi.  For general GSS-API information,
and some programming examples, a good guide is available online at
@url{http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-1331}.

Shishi exposes the GSS-API through the standard `gssapi.h' header file
and the library `libshishi-gss'.  To avoid conflicting with other
GSS-API implementations on your system, the header file is installed
in a sub-directory `shishi/' under the header file location specified
when building Shishi.  You must include this in all programs using the
library, either directly or through some other header file, like this:

@example
#include <shishi/gssapi.h>
@end example

The library `libshishi-gss' is installed in the normal object code
library location.

To facilitate finding the proper parameters for your compiler, the
@command{pkg-config} tool can be used.  Compile your application
@file{foo.c} with the Shishi GSS interface like this:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config shishi-gss --cflags --libs`
@end example

Of course you do not need to use both @option{--cflags} and
@option{--libs} at the same time, see the full discussion elsewhere in
this manual (@pxref{Building the source}), but note that you must use
`shishi-gss' instead of `shishi' as the library parameter to
@command{pkg-config}.
