Subject: GNU Generic Security Service 1.0.2 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
GSSLib is an implementation of the Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSS-API).  GSS-API is used by network applications to
implement security services.  For example, an application can use GSS to
authenticate a user against a SMTP or IMAP server for sending or
receiving e-mail.  GSS consists of a library, a manual, and a command
line tool for debugging purposes.

Noteworthy changes since the last version:

** gss/api.h: Added RFC 5587 const typedefs.
The new types are gss_const_buffer_t, gss_const_channel_bindings_t,
gss_const_ctx_id_t, gss_const_cred_id_t, gss_const_name_t,
gss_const_OID, and gss_const_OID_set.

** gss/api.h, gss/ext.h: Moved RFC 6339 functions from ext.h to api.h.
The functions gss_oid_equal, gss_encapsulate_token, and
gss_decapsulate_token are now standardized.  The types have changed
slightly to used RFC 5587 const types instead.  This does not affect
the ABI and doesn't modify any semantics: the functions did not modify
the non-const parameters before.

** i18n: Translations were updated.

** build: Update gnulib files.  Several QA bug fixes.

** API and ABI modifications.
gss_oid_equal:
gss_encapsulate_token:
gss_decapsulate_token: See above.

There is a known problem building this release on MinGW with MSVC as the
compiler, fortunately there is a workaround available -- please see
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-libtasn1/2011-11/msg00001.html
for more information.

While written to be flexible with regards to different GSS mechanisms,
the only currently supported mechanism is Kerberos V5 via GNU Shishi.
Mutual and non-mutual authentication and channel bindings, as client
and server, is supported.  Message privacy protection using DES and
3DES is supported.

GSS aims to be internationalized, thread safe and portable.  GSS is
written in ANSI/ISO C89, and has been ported to numerous platforms, even
cross compiled to embedded platforms such as Motorola Coldfire.

GSS is a GNU project, and is licensed under the GNU General Public
License version 3 or later.

Improving GSS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GSS useful and wish to contribute back.  You can
contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money or
equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GSS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GSS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.
