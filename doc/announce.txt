GSSLib is an implementation of the Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSS-API).  GSS-API is used by network servers to
provide security services.  For example, GSS can be used to authenticate
a client against SMTP or IMAP servers.  GSS consists of a library, a
manual, and a command line tool for debugging purposes.

Noteworthy changes since the last version:

* Version 0.1.3 (released 2010-03-15)

** KRB5: Add support for channel bindings.

** Build fixes and code cleanups.

** i18n: Added Finnish translation, thanks to Jorma Karvonen.

** i18n: Added Italian translation, thanks to Sergio Zanchetta.

** API and ABI modifications.
No changes since last version.

While written to be flexible with regards to different GSS mechanisms,
the only currently supported mechanism is Kerberos 5 via GNU Shishi.
Mutual and non-mutual authentication, as client and server, is
supported.  Message privacy protection using DES and 3DES is supported.

GSS aims to be internationalized, thread safe and portable.  GSS is
written in ANSI/ISO C89, and has been ported to numerous platforms, even
cross compiled to embedded platforms such as Motorola Coldfire.

GSS is a GNU project, and is licensed under the GNU General Public
License version 3 or later.

Improving GSS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GSS useful and wish to contribute back.  You can
contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money or
equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GSS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GSS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.
