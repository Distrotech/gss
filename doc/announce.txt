Subject: GNU Generic Security Service 1.0.1 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
GSSLib is an implementation of the Generic Security Service
Application Program Interface (GSS-API).  GSS-API is used by network
servers to provide security services.  For example, GSS can be used to
authenticate a client against SMTP or IMAP servers.  GSS consists of a
library, a manual, and a command line tool for debugging purposes.

Noteworthy changes since the last version:

* Version 1.0.1 (released 2010-05-20)

** gss: New --list-mechanisms (-l) to list supported mechanisms in library.

** doc: Added section documenting command-line tool "gss".

** doc: Added PDF version of API reference manual.
See doc/reference/gss.pdf.

** i18n: Translations were updated.

** build: The check for GNU Shishi now requires 0.0.42 or later.
Earlier Shishi versions had bugs that caused the self-checks to fail.

** build: Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications.
No changes since last version.

While written to be flexible with regards to different GSS mechanisms,
the only currently supported mechanism is Kerberos V5 via GNU Shishi.
Mutual and non-mutual authentication and channel bindings, as client
and server, is supported.  Message privacy protection using DES and
3DES is supported.

GSS aims to be internationalized, thread safe and portable.  GSS is
written in ANSI/ISO C89, and has been ported to numerous platforms, even
cross compiled to embedded platforms such as Motorola Coldfire.

GSS is a GNU project, and is licensed under the GNU General Public
License version 3 or later.

Improving GSS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GSS useful and wish to contribute back.  You can
contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money or
equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GSS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GSS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.
