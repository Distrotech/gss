* Changes in 0.0.5 (unreleased)

** Bug fixes.

* Changes in 0.0.4 (released 2003-08-10)

** GSS is a GNU project.

** Kerberos 5 crypto fixes.
This release accompany Shishi 0.0.1.

* Changes in 0.0.3 (released 2003-07-02)

** Includes compatibility functionality from gnulib in gl/.

** Documentation improvements.
The file README-alpha contains some hints for binary packagers.
Essentially, don't distribute shared libraries, as this package is too
immature to bump the shared object version for every modification
currently.

** Bugfixes and cleanups.

* Changes in 0.0.2 (released 2003-06-28)

** Server mode works (a little).
GNU MailUtils can use GSS for its native GSSAPI authentication in
server mode, which then interoperate with (at least) the GNU SASL
command line client using GSS.

** Memory allocated via xalloc from gnulib.
This takes care of out of memory errors, see the new section in the
manual named "Out of Memory handling".

* Changes in 0.0.1 (released 2003-06-12)

** Error handling.

** Swedish translation.

** Improved manual.

** Bug fixes.

* Changes in 0.0.0 (released 2003-06-02)

** Initial release.
The source code framework is in place, an outline of the documentation
is ready, and there are some simple self tests.  The Kerberos 5
mechanism (RFC 1964) supports mutual authentication and the standard
DES cipher.  The non-standard 3DES cipher is also implemented, but
unfortunately there are no specifications for AES.  GNU SASL can use
this version to connect to GNU Mailutils and Cyrus IMAP servers that
use the GSS implementations from MIT Kerberos or Heimdal.  Server mode
is not supported yet.
