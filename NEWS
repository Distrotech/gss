** Initial release.

The source code framework is in place, an outline of the documentation
is ready, and there are some simple self tests.  The Kerberos 5
mechanism (RFC 1964) supports mutual authentication and the standard
DES cipher.  The non-standard 3DES cipher is also implemented, but
unfortunately there are no specifications for AES.  GNU SASL can use
this version to connect to GNU Mailutils and Cyrus IMAP servers that
use the GSS implementations from MIT Kerberos or Heimdal.  Server mode
is not supported yet.
