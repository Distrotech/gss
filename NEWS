* Version 0.0.18 (unreleased)

* Version 0.0.17 (released 2006-04-30)

** Debian packages are available from http://josefsson.org/gss/debian/

** The library is linked with -no-undefined, for mingw32 cross compiles.

** The link test for Shishi was improved.

** Gnulib files were updated.

** API and ABI modifications.
No changes since last version.

* Version 0.0.16 (released 2005-08-11)

** Kinyarwanda translation added, by Steve Murphy.

** The help-gss@gnu.org mailing list is now mentioned in documentation.

** The license template in files were updated with the new FSF address.

** API and ABI modifications.
gss_release_oid: REMOVED.  It seem it was the wrong thing to export
   this API, although the underlaying question (who is responsible for
   managing dynamically allocated OIDs?  How?) is still unanswered.

* Version 0.0.15 (released 2004-11-22)

** Documentation improvements.
For example, you can now browse the GSS manual using DevHelp.

** Libtool's -export-symbols-regex is now used to only export official APIs.
Before, applications might accidentally access internal functions.
Note that this is not supported on all platforms, so you must still
make sure you are not using undocumented symbols in GSS.

* Version 0.0.14 (released 2004-10-15)

** gss_import_name and gss_duplicate_name no longer clone the OID.
Instead, only the pointer to the OID is cloned.  It seem unclear where
a cloned OID would be deallocated.

** Fixed handling of sequence numbers in gss_accept_sec_context, for servers.

** Fix crash in gss_accept_sec_context for NULL values of ret_flags.

** Fix memory leaks.

** Sync with new Shishi 0.0.18 API.

* Version 0.0.13 (released 2004-08-08)

** Revamp of gnulib compatibility files.

** More translations.
French (by Michel Robitaille) and Romanian (by Laurentiu Buzdugan).

* Version 0.0.12 (released 2004-08-01)

** Added rudimentary self tests of Kerberos 5 context init/accept.
Tests client and server authentication, with and without mutual
authentication, and that various aspects of the API like ret_flags
work.

** Various fixes, discovered while writing the Kerberos 5 self test.

** Cross compile builds should work.
It should work for any sane cross compile target, but the only tested
platform is uClibc/uClinux on Motorola Coldfire.

* Version 0.0.11 (released 2004-04-18)

** Minor cleanups to the core header file.
Using xom.h is no longer supported (the file doesn't exist on modern
systems).

** Kerberos 5 sequence number handling fixed.
First, gss_init_sec_context set the sequence numbers correctly, before
the incorrect sequence numbers prevented gss_(un)wrap from working
correctly.  Secondly, gss_unwrap now check the sequence numbers
correctly.  This was prompted by the addition of randomized sequence
numbers by default in Shishi 0.0.15.

** The compatibility files in gl/ where synced with Gnulib.

** Various bugfixes and cleanups.

** Polish translation added, by Jakub Bogusz.

* Version 0.0.10 (released 2004-01-22)

** A command line tool "gss" added in src/.
The tool can be used to split up an GSS-API error code into the
calling error, the routine error and the supplementary info bits, and
to print text describing the error condition.

** gss_display_status can return multiple description texts (using context).

** The Swedish translation has been updated.

** Various cleanups and improvements.

* Version 0.0.9 (released 2004-01-15)

** Implemented gss_export_name and gss_krb5_inquire_cred_by_mech.
The Kerberos 5 backend also support them.

** gss_inquire_cred support default credentials.

** Kerberos 5 gss_canonicalize_name now support all mandatory name types.

** Kerberos 5 gss_accept_sec_context now support sub-session keys in AP-REQ.

** Added new extended function API: gss_userok.
This is the same as invoking gss_export_name on a name, removing the
OID, and then comparing the remaining material using memcmp.

** API documentation in HTML format from GTK-DOC included in doc/reference/.

* Version 0.0.8 (released 2004-01-11)

** Moved all backend specific code into sub-directories of lib/.
This means everything related to the Kerberos 5 backend is now located
in lib/krb5/.  The backend is built into its own library
(libgss-shishi.so), to facilitate future possible use of dlopen to
dynamically load backends.

** The gss_duplicate_name function now allocate the output result properly.

** Man pages for all public functions are included.

** Documentation fixes.  For example, all official APIs are now documented.

* Version 0.0.7 (released 2003-11-26)

** Fixed typo that broke gss_wrap for 3DES with Kerberos 5.

** Improvements to build environment.
The gss.h header file no longer include gss/krb5.h when the Kerberos 5
mechanism is disabled.

** Autoconf 2.59, Automake 1.8 beta, Libtool CVS used.

* Version 0.0.6 (released 2003-09-22)

** Update for Shishi 0.0.7 API.

* Version 0.0.5 (released 2003-08-31)

** Kerberos 5: Subkeys are supported. Shishi 0.0.4 required.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.4 (released 2003-08-10)

** GSS is a GNU project.

** Kerberos 5 crypto fixes.
This release accompany Shishi 0.0.1.

* Version 0.0.3 (released 2003-07-02)

** Includes compatibility functionality from gnulib in gl/.

** Documentation improvements.
The file README-alpha contains some hints for binary packagers.
Essentially, don't distribute shared libraries, as this package is too
immature to bump the shared object version for every modification
currently.

** Bugfixes and cleanups.

* Version 0.0.2 (released 2003-06-28)

** Server mode works (a little).
GNU MailUtils can use GSS for its native GSSAPI authentication in
server mode, which then interoperate with (at least) the GNU SASL
command line client using GSS.

** Memory allocated via xalloc from gnulib.
This takes care of out of memory errors, see the new section in the
manual named "Out of Memory handling".

* Version 0.0.1 (released 2003-06-12)

** Error handling.

** Swedish translation.

** Improved manual.

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.0 (released 2003-06-02)

** Initial release.
The source code framework is in place, an outline of the documentation
is ready, and there are some simple self tests.  The Kerberos 5
mechanism (RFC 1964) supports mutual authentication and the standard
DES cipher.  The non-standard 3DES cipher is also implemented, but
unfortunately there are no specifications for AES.  GNU SASL can use
this version to connect to GNU Mailutils and Cyrus IMAP servers that
use the GSS implementations from MIT Kerberos or Heimdal.  Server mode
is not supported yet.
