* Changes in 0.0.0 (released 2003-06-02)

** Initial release.

The source code framework is in place, an outline of the documentation
is ready, and there are some simple self tests.  The Kerberos 5
mechanism supports mutual authentication and the standard DES cipher
and non-standard 3DES cipher.  GNU SASL can use this version to
connect to GNU Mailutils and Cyrus IMAP servers, where the latter two
servers uses the GSS implementations in MIT Kerberos or Heimdal.
Server mode is not supported yet.
