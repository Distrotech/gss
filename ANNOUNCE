See the end for copying conditions.

GPL GSS-API is an implementation of the Generic Security Service
Application Program Interface (GSS-API).  GSS-API is used by network
servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to provide security security services,
e.g., authenticate clients against servers.

GPL GSS-API contains a library (`libggssapi'), a command line utility
(`ggssapi') to access the library from the shell, and a manual.

GPL GSS-API is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.

GPL GSS-API is licensed under the GNU Public License.
